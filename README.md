## Prerequisites
It is recommended to install PhpStorm, or similar environment, in order to facilitate easier
code review and tracing. It is available as a free 30-day trial.
https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/

- Docker
- PhpStorm (recommended)

## Environment Setup
Spin up docker containers and initialize the application
```shell
chmod a+x setup-environment.sh
./setup-environment.sh
```
- Open `<root>/docker/influxdb/config/influx-configs`
- Copy token value from line `token = "VB_LSJOw1spqi577hGhZDcngDK0pLPOjcEKrgPphiaF5xonbZX6TOQnupwcKPCYPB3v_DOHH03dzvEnlSXwT6Q=="`
- Open `<root>/.env`
- Add token value to `INFLUXDB_TOKEN=`

## Development Site
- http://localhost:8080

## Available User Accounts
The password for all generated user accounts is `password`

- user1@eightsleep.com 
- user2@eightsleep.com 
- user3@eightsleep.com 

## Code
The best place to start digging in is in the seeder file. 
It best demonstrates how the code I wrote works, aside from a presentation,
and is the easiest way to trace into the code base.
```
<root>/database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php
```

### File Structure
Here are the critical file paths to help you focus and review the code I generated instead of framework code

#### Backend
```
// Integration code specifically for the Laravel framework
<root>/app/EightSleep

// Migrations are timestamped and in time order
// All migrations prior to 2023_08_25_103343_create_linked_user_accounts_table.php were generated by the framework
<root>/database/migrations
```
